This a modified version of C'Ts UMBPCI for the MiSTeR ao486. It turns the
unused memory between 640K and 1M into UMBs. You will need himem.sys or
another driver providing the UMB API. 

Example config.sys entry:

device=c:\util\umbmist.sys /i=d000-efff

Use openwatcom to rebuild from source.

umbpci.doc contains the documentation for the original program in German.
